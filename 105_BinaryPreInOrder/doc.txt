Title: Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Note:
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.


Note personal:
 binary tree:
             1
            / \
           2   3
          / \
         4   5
 Depth First Traversals:
 (a) Inorder (Left, Root, Right) : 4 2 5 1 3
 (b) Preorder (Root, Left, Right) : 1 2 4 5 3
 (c) Postorder (Left, Right, Root) : 4 5 2 3 1
 
 // 1st item from Preorder is the root: 1
 // 1st -- before the 1 in Inorder is from left sub-tree (4 2 5)
 // right after 1 in Inorder is the right sub-tree (3...)
 // between 1 and 3 in Preorder is the left sub-tree
